# Subtle ZeroDivisionError Avoidance Leading to Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates a Python code snippet that avoids a `ZeroDivisionError` by using an `if/elif` chain, but leads to unexpected and potentially incorrect results. The code calculates a result based on the input `a` and `b`. The intention is to avoid division by zero, but the implementation produces unexpected outputs when either `a` or `b` is zero. This illustrates a potential issue where seemingly robust error handling can mask unexpected behaviors.

## The Bug

The code directly addresses zero division by the conditional statements, but it does so in a way that gives unexpected results.  Specifically, when either `a` or `b` is zero, it returns the other value, instead of potentially raising a flag or returning a specific error code, such as `NaN`, to indicate the problematic condition.
